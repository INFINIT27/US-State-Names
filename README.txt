This program implements a GUI program which intends to map out all the names of
the US States, using Computational Geometry concepts. Once copying all the files
into a Java program and running it, there will be a window pop-out which will 
represent the US map and the borders of each state.

When the user places the cursor on top of one of the states, the program will 
detect where the user put the cursor and print in the bottom right corner the 
state that the user placed the cursor on.
